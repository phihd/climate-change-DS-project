pff costed me the whole evening, but managed to do some good work. Inspired by this paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122112001745#br000160, I use 6 time series data: Sun spot number, SST of North Atlantic, air pressure, volcanic explosivity index, ENSO, and CO2 concentration to predict temperature. You guys can find the data as well as the notebook on github in a separate folder I used vanilla prophet, but the result is already promising. We got an mean absolute error (MAE) of prediction of 0.0919 against their MAE of 0.0624, not too far off ;)
