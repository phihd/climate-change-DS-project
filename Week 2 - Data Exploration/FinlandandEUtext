Finlandâ€™s CO2 levels hit their peak in 2003, at 72.66 million tonnes of CO2. Levels of CO2 have greatly increased due to the industrial revolution, with 
pre-industrial times having levels of Co2 below one million tonnes until 1923. In 2017, Finland reported levels of 44.7 million tonnes, a clear decrease since 2003.
But the work is far from over. Many Finnish companies have promised to be CO2 neutral in the next decade or so, aiming for a CO2 natural Finland. Some companies are
taking it to the next level, such as Jungle Juice Bar have promised to be CO2 negative, meaning their company produces less CO2 than what they compensate for. 
Companies like this give Finland a hopeful future.



Although the EU has had a decrease in CO2 emissions from 1990 to current day (represented as 2014 here), the numbers did not always log in a negative trend. The 
numbers produced by the EU in 1752 was 9.35 million tonnes of CO2, versus their peak of 8.27 billion tonnes in 1990. As mentioned, there has been a decrease in CO2 
emissions since 1990, when regulations were put in place by the EU. Scientists suggest that although growth has slowed all around the world, and in some places even
decreased (such as in the EU) the levels of CO2 have yet to reach their peak.
