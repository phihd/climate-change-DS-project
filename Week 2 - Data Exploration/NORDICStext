Finlandâ€™s CO2 levels hit their peak in 2003, at 72.66 million tonnes of CO2. Levels of CO2 have greatly increased due to the industrial revolution, with 
pre-industrial times having levels of Co2 below one million tonnes until 1923. In 2017, Finland reported levels of 44.7 million tonnes, a clear decrease since 2003.
But the work is far from over. Many Finnish companies have promised to be CO2 neutral in the next decade or so, aiming for a CO2 natural Finland. Some companies are
taking it to the next level, such as Jungle Juice Bar have promised to be CO2 negative, meaning their company produces less CO2 than what they compensate for. 
Companies like this give Finland a hopeful future.

As for the other nordics, they have similar goals of becoming carbon neutral in the next few decades, and are relatively close to accomplishing this goal, much like
Finland. Denmark, despite growing their economy by 78% in the last 40 years, have actually reduced their CO2 levels. As can be seen by the graph, the countries have
stayed relatively the same in the last 3 decades or decreased. The Nordic countries have always had relatviely low levels of greenhouse gas emissions per capita, so
unfortunatley this means that the Nordics going carbon neutral will not have a large effect on the global scale, but can still set an example. There have been 
regulations set by the EU, and the EU has logged a negative trend overall since 1990, which means maybe the rest of the world could follow in their lead.
