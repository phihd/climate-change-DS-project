# climate-change-DS-project
## Introduction  
The goal of this project was to produce a website that portrays climate change data smoothly to interested viewers. We chose to illustrate such indicators as CO2 emissions rising, the ice caps melting, sea levels rising, and the rising of temperatures. We also included calculations that show how volcanic activity, El Ni√±o, and other factors, are not the primary cause for the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere - but rather it is the human activity that has been the driving force. 

Besides, some forecasts of aforementioned indicators in the near future were made using multiple models.

The project was reported in the course CS-C3250 Data Science Project in December, 2020. 

## Credits
